## 💻 What's Working Right Now

### **Complete Voice → Space Pipeline**
```rust
// FULLY FUNCTIONAL END-TO-END!

// 1. Capture from microphone
let mut capture = AudioCapture::new(tx)?;
tokio::spawn(async move { capture.start().await });

// 2. Analyze audio with FFT
let mut analyzer = SpectralAnalyzer::new(44100);
let features = analyzer.analyze(&audio_chunk);

// 3. Map to ELP geometric space
let mapper = VoiceToELPMapper::new();
let (elp, confidence) = mapper.map_with_confidence(&features);

// 4. Create time-stamped tensor
let bead = BeadTensor::from_features(elp, &features, confidence);

// 5. Encrypt if high-value
let storage = SecureStorage::new(&key);
if bead.is_high_value() {
    let encrypted = storage.encrypt(&serialize(&bead))?;
    
    // 6. Store persistently
    let mut lake = ConfidenceLake::open("patterns.lake")?;
    lake.store(bead.timestamp.timestamp_millis() as u64, &encrypted)?;
}
```

**From your voice to encrypted geometric storage - ALL WORKING!** ✨
