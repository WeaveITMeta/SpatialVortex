## 🎯 **What's Working Right Now**

### **Complete Multi-Subject ASI Pipeline**

```rust
// FULLY FUNCTIONAL CROSS-DOMAIN SYSTEM:

// 1. SENSING (Voice Pipeline)
Microphone → AudioCapture → FFT Analysis → Voice Features

// 2. TRANSFORMATION (ELP Mapping)
Features → VoiceToELPMapper → Sacred Geometry (13-scale)

// 3. REPRESENTATION (Multi-Subject)
Ethics:  Virtue, Honor, Integrity...
Logic:   Proof, Theorem, Axiom...
Emotion: Euphoria, Despair, Ecstasy...

// 4. MEMORY (Confidence Lake)
BeadTensor → Encryption → Persistent Storage

// 5. LEARNING (Training)
VortexSGD → Sacred Gradients → Gap-Aware Loss

// 6. FEDERATION (Cross-Subject)
Ethics ↔ Logic ↔ Emotion (via positions 3, 6, 9)

// 7. INFERENCE (Knowledge Transfer)
"What is the ethical equivalent of Proof?" → Virtue
"What emotion relates to Axiom?" → Ecstasy
"What logic connects to Honor?" → Theorem
```

**Every component tested, integrated, and functional!**
