## 1. **Callout Boxes**

Send this to the AI to test callouts (or AI can generate them):

```
> ℹ️ **Info**: This is an informational message about RAG integration.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Be careful when modifying production code.

> ❌ **Error**: Failed to connect to the database.

> ✅ **Success**: Your changes have been saved successfully!

> 💡 **Tip**: Use Ctrl+K to open the command palette.
```

**Expected Output**: Beautiful colored boxes with icons!

## 2. **Enhanced Tables**

Ask AI: "Show me a comparison table of AI features"

Or paste this:

```
| Feature | Status | Priority | ETA |
|---------|--------|----------|-----|
| Streaming | ✅ Done | High | Complete |
| Tool Calling | ✅ Done | High | Complete |
| ThinkingAgent | ✅ Done | High | Complete |
| RAG Integration | ✅ Done | High | Complete |
| Safety Guards | ✅ Done | High | Complete |
| Math Equations | 📋 Planned | Medium | Week 2 |
| Diagrams | 📋 Planned | Low | Month 1 |
```

**Expected Output**: Beautiful table with hover effects!

## 3. **Task Lists**

Ask AI: "Create a task list for deploying my app"

Or paste this:

```
My deployment checklist:
