## 🌟 Ideal Candidate

You're a great fit if you:
- ✅ **Want to build something impossible**: ASI is the ultimate challenge
- ✅ **Think geometrically**: Understand that space and meaning are connected
- ✅ **Love hard problems**: Lock-free data structures, quadratic scaling, 1000 Hz
- ✅ **Ship production code**: Not just research, but real systems
- ✅ **Collaborate deeply**: 5-person team, every voice matters
- ✅ **Move fast**: 18 months to ASI means velocity matters

You're NOT a good fit if you:
- ❌ Need structure and process (we're building as we go)
- ❌ Want work-life balance (this is a sprint, not a marathon)
- ❌ Doubt geometric reasoning (if you think this is crazy, it won't work)
- ❌ Fear failure (we're attempting the impossible)

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is this really achievable in 18 months?**  
A: Yes. We have mathematical proofs (see GEOMETRIC_MATH.md) and a detailed roadmap. This isn't science fiction—it's engineering.

**Q: What if I don't know Rust?**  
A: We can teach Rust (it's just a language). We can't teach geometric intuition or systems thinking.

**Q: Is this fully funded?**  
A: We have committed capital for 18 months. Focus is on building, not fundraising.

**Q: Can I work part-time or contract?**  
A: No. This requires full commitment. 18 months, all-in.

**Q: What happens after 18 months?**  
A: If we succeed: Series A, scale to 50+ engineers, take on OpenAI/Anthropic.  
If we fail: Incredible learning, publishable research, startup on your resume.

**Q: What about intellectual property?**  
A: Core geometric reasoning will be open-sourced (our moat is execution speed).  
Vertical applications will be proprietary.

**Q: Who are the founders?**  
A: Technical founding team with background in AI research, systems engineering, and product. Details in interview.

**Q: Where is the office?**  
A: Remote-first. Considering SF, Seattle, or NYC for hybrid option in Phase 2.

**Q: What's the equity split?**  
A: Founding team gets 5-10% total (across 5 people). Exact allocation based on role, experience, and negotiation.
