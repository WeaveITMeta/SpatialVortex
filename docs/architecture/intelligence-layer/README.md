## Components

### [Hallucination Detection](hallucination-detection.md)
**Signal strength monitoring for truthfulness**

**Detection Method**:
- Signal strength = 3-6-9 pattern frequency
- Strong (0.7-1.0) = coherent, truthful
- Weak (0.0-0.3) = corrupted → hallucination

**Root Cause**:
- Numeric overflow at u64::MAX boundary
- Digital root pattern corruption
- VCP prevents via cyclic resets

### [Context Optimization](context-optimization.md)
**Bayesian context management**

**Approach**:
- Bayesian confidence filtering
- Sparse clustering at sacred positions (3, 6, 9)
- Empty space detection and filling
- Context recovery on demand

**Performance**:
- 70-80% accuracy with only 20-30% context
- 99% reduction in overflow events
- 10× more efficient calculation budget

### [VCP Research](vcp-research.md)
**Research foundation for Vortex Context Preserver**
- Signal subspace analysis
- Pattern coherence measurement
- Checkpoint optimization
- Comparative studies vs transformers

### Reasoning
**Geometric reasoning with sacred positions**
- Spatial relationship detection
- 3-6-9 geometric inference
- Sacred boost application (1.5×)
- Multi-dimensional analysis via ELP

### Learning
**Continuous learning via RAG**
- Document ingestion and chunking
- Sacred geometry relevance scoring
- Vector database with position filtering
- Active learning sample selection
- Confidence Lake integration

### Self-Optimization
**Adaptive strategy improvement**
- Performance tracking per strategy
- Automatic A/B testing
- Meta-learning from failures
- Dynamic weight adjustment
